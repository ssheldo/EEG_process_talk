% description of the dataset settings
% 1) NewBaseline: this has the window of 1024ms, and the baseline is 712-512ms. Epoched to the entrainers
% 2) NewBaseline2: this has the window of 512ms, and the baseline is 456-256ms. Epoched to the entrainers
% 3) Target: Windowsize of 512ms, no baseline epoched to target onset and divided into Valid and Invalid targets
% 4) TargetERP: no time-f, locked to first erp, filter at 50 Hz

%% Settings for loading the raw data
%Datafiles must be in the format exp_participant, e.g. EEGexp_001.vhdr
exp.name = 'MultiFreq';
exp.participants = {'001';'002';'003';'004';'005';'008';'009';'010';'011';'012';'014';'015';'016';'017';'018';'019';'023';'024';'025';'026';'027';'028';'029';'030';'031';'032';'033';'034';'035';'036';'037';'038';'039';'040';'041';'042'};
exp.pathname = 'M:\Data\MultiFreq\EEG';

% Choose how to organize your datasets. 
% The sets are different trial types that contain comparable events. 
% Examples of different sets: 10Hz/12Hz stimulation on different trials; emotional vs non-emotional images on different trials.
% Each row is a different set. 
% The events are stimuli within the trial. 
% Examples of different events. Missing vs present targets, valid vs invalid targets, detected vs undetected responses.
% Each column is a different event. 
% You can collect multiple triggers into one event with square brackets [].

exp.events = {[11 21], [13 23]};    %must be matrix (sets x events)
          
exp.setname = {'Baseline'}; %name the rows
exp.event_names = {'Eyes Closed','Eyes Open'}; %name the columns

% Each item in the exp.events matrix will become a seperate dataset, including only those epochs referenced by the events in that item. 
%e.g. 3 rows x 4 columns == 12 datasets/participant

% The settings will be saved as a new folder. It lets you save multiple datasets with different preprocessing parameters.
exp.settings = 'Baseline';
 


%% Preprocessing Settings
%segments settings
exp.segments = 'on'; %Do you want to make new epoched datasets? Set to "off" if you are only changing the tf settings.
%Where are your electrodes? (.ced file)
exp.electrode_locs = 'M:\Analysis\ElectrodeLocs\EOG-electrode-locs-32.ced';

%% Filter the data?
exp.filter = 'off';
exp.lowpass = 50;
exp.highpass = 0;

%% Re-referencing the data
exp.refelec = 1; %which electrode do you want to re-reference to?
exp.brainelecs = [2:32]; %list of every electrode collecting brain data (exclude mastoid reference, EOGs, HR, EMG, etc.

%% Epoching the data
%Choose what to epoch to. The default [] uses every event listed above.
%Alternatively, you can epoch to something else in the format {'TRIG'}. Use triggers which are at a consistent time point in every trial.
exp.epochs = []; 
exp.epochslims = [-1 180]; %in seconds; epoched trigger is 0 e.g. [-1 2]
exp.epochbaseline = [-200 0]; %remove the for each epoched set, in ms. e.g. [-200 0] 

%% Artifact rejection. 
% Choose the threshold to reject trials. More lenient threshold followed by an (optional) stricter threshold 
exp.preocularthresh = []; %First happens before the ocular correction.
exp.postocularthresh = []; %Second happens after. Leave blank [] to skip
 
%% Blink Correction
%the Blink Correction wants dissimilar events (different erps) seperated by commas and similar events (similar erps) seperated with spaces. See 'help gratton_emcp'
exp.selection_cards = {'11 21','13 23'};
%%%%



%% Time-Frequency settings
%Do you want to run time-frequency analyses? (on/off)
exp.tf = 'off';
%Do you want to save the single-trial data? (on/off) (Memory intensive!!!)
exp.singletrials = 'on';
%Do you want to use all the electrodes or just a few? Leave blank [] for all (will use same as exp.brainelecs)
exp.tfelecs = [];
%Saving the single trial data is memory intensive. Just use the electrodes you need. 
exp.singletrialselecs = [2];

%% Wavelet settings
%how long is your window going to be? (Longer window == BETTER frequency resolution & WORSE time resolution)
exp.winsize = 1024; %in ms; use numbers that are 2^x, e.g. 2^10 == 1024ms
%baseline will be subtracted from the power variable. It is relative to your window size.
exp.erspbaseline = NaN; %e.g., [-200 0] will use [-200-exp.winsize/2 0-exp.winsize/2]; Can use just NaN for no baseline
%Instead of choosing a windowsize, you can choose a number of cycles per frequency. See "help popnewtimef"
exp.cycles = [0]; %leave it at 0 to use a consistent time window
exp.freqrange = [1 40]; % what frequencies to consider? default is [1 50]
%%%%
  


%% Save your pipeline settings
save([exp.settings '_Settings'],'exp') %save these settings as a .mat file. This will help you remember what settings were used in each dataset




%% Run Preprocessing
Preprocessing(exp) %comment out if you're only doing analysis



%% Run Analysis
%Don't want to change all the above settings? Load the settings from the saved .mat file.

%choose the data types to load into memory (on/off)
anal.segments = 'on'; %load the EEG segments?
anal.tf = 'on'; %load the time-frequency data?

anal.singletrials = 'on'; %load the single trial data?
anal.entrainer_freqs = [20; 15; 12; 8.5; 4]; %Single trial data is loaded at the event time, and at the chosen frequency. 

anal.tfelecs = []; %load all the electodes, or just a few? Leave blank [] for all.
anal.singletrialselecs = [2 3 4 6];

Analysis(exp,anal) % The Analysis primarily loads the processed data. It will attempt to make some figures, but most analysis will need to be done in seperate scripts.
