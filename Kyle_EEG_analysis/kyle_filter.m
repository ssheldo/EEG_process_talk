%[Y_filt] = kyle_filter(Y,Fs,hipass,lopass)
% Takes the time x channel data matrix Y, filters out a single frequency
% band,
% Input is: 
%           Y  - data matrix, time points by channels
%           Fs - Sampling Frequency in Hz
%           hipass - lower bound of filter
%           lopass - upper bound of filter
% Output is:
%            Y_filt - same as Y but not filtered

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%Initialize some variables
n_chan = size(Y,2);  %number of channels
Y_filt = Y;  %Allocate memory for output
